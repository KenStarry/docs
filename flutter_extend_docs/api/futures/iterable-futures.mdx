```dart Futures icon="forward" lines wrap
final futures = [fetch1(), fetch2(), fetch3(), fetch4()];

// Prioritizes speed (results may be out of order)
final results = await futures.runWithLimit(2);

// Prioritizes order (slower, but results[0] matches fetch1's result)
final orderedResults = await futures.runWithLimitOrdered(2);
```

### 🏎️ Throughput Priority (Unordered)
{/*  ------------------ */}
<ResponseField name="runWithLimit(int limit)" type="Future<List<T>>" post={["async"]}>

<Card>
    <ParamField body="limit" type="int" required>
        The maximum number of `Futures` to run simultaneously.
    </ParamField>
</Card>

Executes multiple Futures concurrently with a maximum limit. When one finishes, the next is immediately launched.

<CodeGroup>
    ```dart Futures icon="forward" lines wrap
    // Runs 2 at a time. If fetch2 finishes before fetch1,
    // results will be [result2, result1, ...].
    final results = await futures.runWithLimit(2);
    ```
</CodeGroup>
<Note>
    The results are ordered by completion time and are not guaranteed to match the input iterable's order. Prioritize this for maximum speed.
</Note>
</ResponseField>

### ✍️ Order Preservation

{/*  ------------------ */}
<ResponseField name="runWithLimitOrdered(int limit)" type="Future<List<T>>" post={["async"]}>

<Card>
    <ParamField body="limit" type="int" required>
        The maximum number of `Futures` to run simultaneously.
    </ParamField>
</Card>

Executes multiple Futures concurrently while guaranteeing the final list order matches the original input iterable's index.

<CodeGroup>
    ```dart Futures icon="forward" lines wrap
    // Final result order is always [result1, result2, result3].
    final orderedResults = await futures.runWithLimitOrdered(2);
    ```
</CodeGroup>
<Note>
     This requires slightly more internal complexity to manage the results, making it marginally slower but ensuring index reliability.
