                The maximum number of `Futures` to run simultaneously.
            </ParamField>
        </Card>

        Executes multiple Futures concurrently with a maximum limit. When one finishes, the next is immediately launched.

        ```dart lines wrap
        // Runs 2 at a time. If fetch2 finishes before fetch1,
        // results will be [result2, result1, ...].
        final results = await futures.runWithLimit(2);
        ```
        <Note>
            The results are ordered by completion time and are not guaranteed to match the input iterable's order. Prioritize this for maximum speed.
        </Note>

    <Step title="✍️ Order Preservation">
        {/*  ------------------ */}
        <ResponseField name="runWithLimitOrdered(int limit)" type="Future<List<T>>" post={["async"]}>

        <Card>
            <ParamField body="limit" type="int" required>
                The maximum number of `Futures` to run simultaneously.
            </ParamField>
        </Card>

        Executes multiple Futures concurrently while guaranteeing the final list order matches the original input iterable's index.

        ```dart lines wrap
        // Final result order is always [result1, result2, result3].
        final orderedResults = await futures.runWithLimitOrdered(2);
        ```
        <Note>
             This requires slightly more internal complexity to manage the results, making it marginally slower but ensuring index reliability.
